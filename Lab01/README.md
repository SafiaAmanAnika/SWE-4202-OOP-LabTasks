# üè• Humanity Hospital Management System üè•

## 1.1 Background

 The goal of this project is to apply object-oriented principles to design and implement a simple hospital appointment system in Java.
 
 Humanity Hospital, based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, is known for its volunteer-driven services and consists of multiple departments and doctors. Patients can book appointments based on doctor availability and scheduling.

## 1.2 Task Description

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Write and Run First Java Program
- Develop a simple Java program to test setup and understand basic syntax and structure.

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Analyze and Design the Appointment System
- Read and understand the hospital scenario.
- Apply object-oriented design steps to build the system:
  - Identify nouns and classify them into possible classes.
  - Identify class attributes.
  - Identify verbs to suggest methods.
  - Create class cards for each entity.
  - Identify relationships between classes and their multiplicity.
  - Verify the responsibilities of each class.

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Implement the Java Code
- Implement the designed classes in Java.
- Include attributes, constructors, and appropriate getter/setter methods.
- Follow standard naming conventions and encapsulation practices.

## 1.3 Output

- A Java-based appointment system representing the structure of Humanity Hospital.
- Key classes implemented:
  - `Doctor`
  - `Patient`
  - `Appointment`
  - `Department`
  - `Hospital`
- Demonstrates fundamental object-oriented principles such as:
  - Encapsulation
  - Class responsibilities
  - Inter-object relationships
